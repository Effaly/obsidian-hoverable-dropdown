# What it does

# How to install 
1. Download the Hoverable Dropdown.css file 
2. Open the Obsidian Vault folder in which you want to use this
3. Open the `.obsidian` folder 
4. Open the `snippets` folder and paste the file in there. If you don't have a `snippets` folder, create it. 
6. Once done, go to Setting -> Appearance and scroll down (If you can't see it, close and reopen Obsidian)
7. Toggle Hoverable Dropdown on 

# How to Use 
This is the code from the example above: 
```
>[!navmenu|white|coffee2]
>- Hover
>- Over 
>  - More menus
>- Me
>  - Another menu
>    - Even more menus
>- !!!
>  - As many as you need
```

The line `[!navmenu|white|coffee2]` can be modified.

Instead of `white`, you can add all available **LINK COLORS**. 
Instead of `coffee2` you can use any available **BACKGROUND COLOR**

# Note 
It works best when you additionally use [the wide view from the modular css layout snippet](https://github.com/efemkay/obsidian-modular-css-layout?tab=readme-ov-file#wide-views).

# Color scheme 
Apart from a neutral white, grey, black palett for links and some pastel backgrounds, the colors were picked from the [extended](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) [AnuPpuccin](https://github.com/AnubisNekhet/AnuPpuccin) themes. Colors from themes come with their base color and an accent color.
